# Raspberry Smarthome System.
This is a DIY smarthome system build on the raspberry microprossesors and singleboard computers.
I will add and change this document as the project proceeds.

## Programming languages.
The systems running on the microprocessor clients will be written in *c++* using the [PICO-SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).
For now systems running on the singleboard computers will mostly be written in *Python* this might change later as my skills evolve.

## TTFHW(PICO-SDK, BLINK)
Tutorial on how to write your *first C++ program - Build a uf2 file - mount the file and run it on the pico w - using the PICO-SDK library*.
Press [tutorial](https://github.com/lufsen98/Smarthome/blob/main/blink/README.md) if you want to proceed to this guide.


## Tempsensor Raspberry Pico W.
Purpose is to gather indoor temp data using a Raspberry Pico W.
To get the motionssensor setup and running on the Pico W you can proceed to the Tempsensor folder and follow this [README](https://github.com/lufsen98/Smarthome/blob/main/tempsensor/README.md)
