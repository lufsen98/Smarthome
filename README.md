# Raspberry Smarthome System.
This is a DIY smarthome system build on the raspberry microprossesors and singleboard computers.
I will add and change this document as the project proceeds.

## Programming languages.
The systems running on the microprocessor clients will be written in *c++* using the [PICO-SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).
For now systems running on the singleboard computers will mostly be written in *Python* this might change later as my skills evolve.


## Tempsensor Raspberry Pico W.
Purpose is to gather indoor temp data using a Raspberry Pico W.
To get the motionssensor setup and running on the Pico W you can proceed to the Tempsensor folder and follow this [README](https://github.com/lufsen98/Smarthome/blob/main/tempsensor/README.md)
